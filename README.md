##Task Description

This task involved the design and development of a fully functional basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create a responsive and interactive web application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project serves as an excellent example of how front-end technologies can work together to produce a seamless and visually appealing user interface with dynamic behavior.

The foundation of the calculator is built using HTML. It provides the essential structure of the application, including the display screen and all functional buttons. The calculator layout consists of a container that holds an input field at the top, which acts as the display area for numbers and results. Below the display are buttons arranged in a 4x4 grid pattern representing digits (0–9), four arithmetic operators (+, –, *, /), a clear (C) button, and an equals (=) button. The HTML layout is clean, semantic, and easy to understand, making it straightforward to apply styles and add interactivity later on.

CSS is used to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the calculator. The styling is done using the CSS Grid layout system, which makes it easy to align buttons into a structured and evenly spaced format. The calculator features a modern design with a clean white background, soft shadows, and smooth border-radius for a polished look. Different buttons are color-coded for better usability—numerical buttons have a neutral shade, operator buttons are highlighted in a distinct indigo color, and the clear and equals buttons are styled with red and green, respectively. Hover effects and transitions are included to make the user interaction feel responsive and intuitive. The display screen also uses contrasting background and text colors to ensure that input values and results are easily readable.

JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity and handling the logic behind the calculator's operations. Event listeners are attached to each button to detect user actions. When a number button is clicked, the corresponding value is added to a variable and displayed in the input field. When an operator is selected, the first value is stored and the input field is cleared for the second value. On pressing the equals button, the JavaScript logic evaluates the expression using the eval() function and displays the result. The clear button resets all variables and clears the display. The implementation involves conditional statements to handle user inputs correctly and ensure that calculations occur in a valid sequence. This approach provides a smooth and user-friendly experience without unnecessary complexity.

Overall, this calculator project demonstrates the practical application of HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for functionality. It effectively combines design and logic to produce a usable web-based tool. The modular code structure, clear logic flow, and clean UI make it a suitable beginner project while also laying a solid foundation for more advanced features in the future. This task not only showcases front-end development skills but also emphasizes good coding practices, UI/UX considerations, and interactivity in web applications.
